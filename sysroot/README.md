# Sysroot
B8G Is a whole self containing OS Kernel Implemented at present on top of existing Software as the final product does not exist.

We reuse as minimal compat layer GNU Implementations whithout GNU License Because of GPL Errors. 
Note: If you include GPL in your Software your software Gets GPL or you violate GPL with a 98% Chance if it is a bigger project.
If it is small then chances are high that GPL does not apply because they did copy them self. It is Frustrating. Thats why Projects
like the unlicense are so importent for the world to clear that complexity out. Apache and MIT are a bit more frindly as they
Simply want that you reference them. 

We plan to try to support the rust coreutils project which trys to replace gnu tools but does that less efficent on the long run.
We plan to build a platform that they can reuse we simply replace the core utils on denos v8 bindings and will look how that works.
It is less high priority as we already Replace GNU utils but not for our own Build process that something to work on.
